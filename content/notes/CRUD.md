# CRUD
CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic functions that persistent storage applications should be able to perform on data.

- **Create**: add new data to persistent storage.
- **Read**: retrieve data from persistent storage.
- **Update**: modify existent data in persistent storage.
- **Delete**: remove data from persistent storage.

CRUD operations provide a standardized way to interact with data storage system.
