### 1.1. Time-series & forecasting models

**Time-series forecasting** models are the models that are capable to **predict** **future values** based on **previously** **observed** **values**. Time-series forecasting is widely used for **non-stationary data**. **Non-stationary data** are called the data whose statistical properties e.g. the mean and standard deviation are not constant over time but instead, these metrics vary over time.

These non-stationary input data (used as input to these models) are usually called **time-series.** Some examples of time-series include the temperature values over time, stock price over time, price of a house over time etc. So, the input is a **signal** (time-series) that is **defined by observations taken sequentially in time**.

**Observation: Time-series** data is recorded on a **discrete** **time** **scale**.
