# How to contribute to open source

## What it means to contribute

> [!idea]+ You don’t just have to work on software projects
> Even if you’re a software developer, working on a documentation project can help you get started in open source. It’s often less intimidating to work on projects that don’t involve code, and the process of collaboration will build your confidence and experience.


## Orienting yourself to a new project
- A typical open source project has the following types of people:
	- **Author:** The person/s or organization that created the project
	- **Owner:** The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author)
	- **Maintainers:** Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project (They may also be authors or owners of the project.)
	- **Contributors:** Everyone who has contributed something back to the project
	- **Community Members:** People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction

## Finding a project to contribute to
- Start by thinking about the projects you already use, or want to use. The projects you’ll actively contribute to are the ones you find yourself coming back to.
- If you’re looking for existing issues you can fix, every open source project has a `/contribute` page that highlights beginner-friendly issues you can start out with. Navigate to the main page of the repository on GitHub, and add `/contribute` at the end of the URL (for example https://github.com/facebook/react/contribute).
- You can also use one of the following resources to help you discover and contribute to new projects:
	- [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore/)
	- [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com)
	- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
	- [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
	- [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/)
	- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/)
	- [First Contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io)
	- [SourceSort](https://web.archive.org/web/20201111233803/https://www.sourcesort.com/)

- **A checklist before you contribute**
	- When you’ve found a project you’d like to contribute to, do a quick scan to make sure that the project is suitable for accepting contributions. Otherwise, your hard work may never get a response. 
	  Here’s a handy checklist to evaluate whether a project is good for new contributors.
		 -  **Meets the definition of open source**
			  - [ ] Does it have a license? Usually, there is a file called LICENSE in the root of the repository.
		- **Project actively accepts contributions**
			- Look at the commit activity on the main branch. On GitHub, you can see this information in the Insights tab of a repository’s homepage, such as [Virtual-Coffee](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/pulse)
			 - [ ] When was the latest commit?
			 - [ ] How many contributors does the project have?
			 - [ ] How often do people commit? (On GitHub, you can find this by clicking "Commits" in the top bar.)
			- Next, look at the project’s issues:
			 - [ ] How many open issues are there?
			 - [ ] Do maintainers respond quickly to issues when they are opened?
			 - [ ] Is there active discussion on the issues?
			 - [ ] Are the issues recent?
			 - [ ] Are issues getting closed? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Issues page to see closed issues.)
			- Now do the same for the project’s pull requests:
			- [ ] How many open pull requests are there?
			- [ ] Do maintainers respond quickly to pull requests when they are opened?
			- [ ] Is there active discussion on the pull requests?
			- [ ] Are the pull requests recent?
			- [ ] How recently were any pull requests merged? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Pull Requests page to see closed PRs.)
		- **Project is welcoming**
			- A project that is friendly and welcoming signals that they will be receptive to new contributors.
			- [ ] Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
			- [ ] Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?
			- [ ] Do pull requests get reviewed?
			- [ ] Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?
