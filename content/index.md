Personal blog that works as a digital garden. Here, you can find all the notes I am working on, while I work on them. It's my best attempt at blogging, where I try to remove any friction between me and the act of writing by 'working with the garage door open'.
Warning: it may look like a mess.

# Structure of this blog
I organized my digital garden into the following three main folders:
- **inbox**: [writing inbox, as conceived by Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUP4GuzPF33dWkZPiu9N6V5), where all new concepts, underdeveloped ideas, prompts for future notes and excerpts from external resources are stored waiting to be addressed, digested and organized into notes.
- **analyses**: folder containing the output of my learning process applied to various external learning resources, like online courses, books, articles etc. General concepts and ideas stemming from these analyses may be later distilled into proper notes.
- **notes**: self-sufficient, linked, atomic notes. Basically, the product of my thinking. These notes will evolve over time.

What will be made public in this blog will most likely be the content of the `analyses` and `notes` folders, as anything in the `inbox` folder would be too unorganized and pointless to be published.
